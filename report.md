Survival Analysis Report 

Factors Affecting Churn Risk

Using the LogNormal AFT model, we analyzed the telecom customer dataset to understand which factors drive churn risk and influence customer lifetime. This analysis revealed that the factors related to service have the strongest impact on customer retention. Customers with Plus, E-service, or Total service packages show significantly longer expected lifetimes compared to Basic service customers, with exp(coef) values of 2.30, 2.78, and 2.77, respectively. This means that customers using comprehensive service packages are more than twice as likely to remain with the company over time. This just shows how important it is to offer high-value service bundles attractive to customers.
Next, internet and voice service subscriptions also play a crucial role in retention. The negative coefficients for these features indicate that customers who use internet or voice services tend to stay longer with coefficients 0.42 and 0.64 respectively. In other words, having these services reduces churn probability and strengthens loyalty. Demographic factors such as age and residential stability have a positive impact on retention. As we can see, older customers and those who have lived longer at the same address are less likely to churn. On the other hand, unmarried customers exhibit a bigger risk of churn (coefficient=0.65), indicating that the marital status of customers can also influence their behavior.
 
Most Valuable Customer Segments
For this analysis, valuable customers are defined as those that have both high CLV and low churn probability. The top 25% of customers by CLV are considered high-value, and the top 25% by predicted 12-month churn probability are considered high-risk. Interestingly, there is no overlap between high-value and high-risk customers. This can mean that the most valuable customers are already somewhat loyal. When we look at the different segment levels, we can draw the following insights. Plus service customers have the highest average CLV (2115.48) and the lowest churn probability (4.6%). This makes them the most valuable segment out of all. E-service customers also represent a high-value segment with an average CLV of 2039.32 and a low churn probability of 6.8%. When we look at the Total service customers, we can see that they have moderate CLV (1831.46) and a slightly higher churn probability (13.6%). So, we have potential opportunities for retention improvement with this segment. Basic service customers show a lower average CLV (1688.24) but the highest churn probability (18.97%). This suggests that they should be a high-priority group for targeted retention programs. Lastly, E-service customers without internet or voice services have the highest average CLV (2201.19). This identifies specific subgroups that could benefit from specific retention strategies, such as different attractive bundles or loyalty programs.

Retention Budget and Recommendations
According to our analysis, the potential annual revenue loss from high-value customers is estimated to be 63120.24. If we allocate, for example, 20% of this potential loss toward retention initiatives, that will result in a recommended annual retention budget of 12624.05.
We can make the following retention strategies:
For the Early-tenure customers, since their churn risk is highest within the first 24 months, we can implement some  individualized onboarding programs and different campaigns that would boost their engagement.
For the customers on Basic service packages, since they are at the highest risk of churn, we can motivate them to upgrade to Plus or E-service packages.
Next, as we saw younger and unmarried customers are more likely to churn. For them, we can design special offers or loyalty programs targeting specifically these groups.
Lastly, we can offer bundles or promotions to customers with high CLV in order to maximize their lifetime value.
In this way,  we will both protect the most profitable customers and improve overall customer lifetime value.
